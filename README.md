# Airbnb-Sentiment-Analysis

Dataset and Motivation
Airbnb started in 2007 and has since exploded into an enormous business generating billions of dollars for hosts every year. The airbnb website offers many services to both hosts and guests, not the least important of which is their system for reviews. Each time there is a booking, both the guest and the host have the opportunity to review and rate their experience. As such, it is extremely important for hosts to consistently provide an experience that is up to the standard of the guest. But what is the guest really looking for? What are the important things that a host can offer that will consistently make guests happy and allow them to maintain their business. These are the questions that we are interested in answering in this exploratory data analysis. In this study we will perform sentiment analysis on airbnb reviews and use the sentiment scores to see if we can develop a model to predict the sentiment of a review. We will explore the text within the reviews to search for features that predict the sentiment. We will also explore other features associated with listings/hosts such as bedrooms, bathrooms, airbnb status, etc.
